# Use of JAX in HEP analysis

Set of introductory lectures on using JAX for likelihood fitting in HEP. 

These were presented at the HSF-India Training Event at TIFR: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1254939/

The dataset for the fit can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLune0rI1BTpPnhVBmj6u33OoppSFIP_/view?usp=share_link

Note that the Jupyter notebooks for lectures are designed to be converted to slides - refer to the links below for the html slides:
